# Titanic-Dataset
CodeSoft Project 1.
This project analyzes the Titanic Dataset to explore survival rates based on gender and age group. Using Power BI, I created interactive visualizations to illustrate key insights. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.
